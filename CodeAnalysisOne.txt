In the code snippet, the block Animal d = new Dog(); creates a reference variable of type Animal that points to an instance of the Dog class. The speak method is overridden in both the Cat and Dog classes, but there is a key difference in the method signatures.The speak method in the Cat class has the same method signature as the one in the base class Animal, which means it overrides the base class method with the same signature. In contrast, the speak method in the Dog class has a different method signature because it takes a short parameter instead of an int parameter. In the statement Console.Write(d.speak(0));, d is of type Animal, and it refers to an instance of the Dog class. However, since d is declared as an Animal, the compiler looks at the speak method declared in the Animal class, which is public virtual string speak(int x). This method does not have a direct override in the Dog class, and it has a different parameter type (int) than the speak method in the Dog class (short).Due to the difference in parameter types, the d.speak(0) call resolves to the base class's method, which is Animal's speak(int x) method. Therefore, the method speak of the Animal class is invoked, and it returns "silence," not "bow-wow." In C#, method resolution is determined at compile-time based on the declared type of the reference variable (d), and not at runtime based on the actual object type (Dog). To invoke the speak method from the Dog class and get "bow-wow" as the output, you would need to declare d as Dog or cast it explicitly to Dog, like this:

// Declare as Dog so that it can speak bow-wow
Dog d = new Dog();
Console.Write(d.speak(0)); // This will emit "bow-wow"

//Explicitly cast to dog
Animal d = new Dog();
Console.Write(((Dog)d).speak(0)); // This will emit "bow-wow"
